		<h1>Static versus Dynamic Websites</h1>
		<h3> Static websites appear the same for every user and only change when the source files are modified, whereas dynamic websites can present different information to different visitors. </h3>

<h2> Static </h2>

    <p> Most portfolio websites are static. The owner picks and chooses what projects they want to display for employers. I mostly like the color pallet and layout of the website. I also really like how his personality shows through in the design, with handwritten fonts placed around. I don't really like how so much of the work is just grouped in the bottom, I don't think that that's what people like to see on landing pages. It also links to a dynamic website, Etsy, where the artist sells his work.</p>

<h2>Dynamic</h2>

    <p>Netflix shows a unique catalogue to each of its user and the layout of endless scrolling and swiping is copied by many other streaming services, meaning Netflix is the blueprint. I also spend a lot of time there so I appreciate that it is personalized. I do dislike how it sometimes seems like you can't find anything good to watch but I am unsure of how that problem could be remedied.</p>

<p> Not sure where this site falls under but it is very entertaining. <a href= "https://peteroravec.com/"> Peter Oravec - Portfolio </a> </p>
